rcvface <facehost> [<proxy>]
  facehost: name/addr of face detector
  proxy: proxy addr [optional]

face [<dev>]
  dev: video device number [0-3]; default 0


if using a relay, in face.cpp, PROXYHOST should be replaced with the address of the relay host in this line (near beginning of main):

  RC(zmq_connect(pub, "tcp://PROXYHOST:7770"));
